./manage_ml_models.sh quick-train AMZN    # Quick training for specific symbols
./manage_ml_models.sh train AMZN AUR PLTR # Train multiple symbols
```

### **Monitoring Commands**
```bash
# Performance monitoring
./monitor_performance.sh                  # One-time performance check
./monitor_performance.sh --continuous     # Continuous monitoring
./monitor_performance.sh --report         # Generate performance report

# Status and dashboard
./manage_ml_models.sh status              # Comprehensive status
./dashboard.sh                            # Monitoring dashboard
```

### **Automation Setup**
```bash
# Setup automatic schedules
./setup_cron_jobs.sh                      # Setup cron jobs
./setup_cron_jobs.sh --systemd            # Setup systemd services

# Manual operations
./manage_ml_models.sh backup              # Backup models
./manage_ml_models.sh clean               # Clean old files
```

## 📅 **Automatic Schedules**

### **Cron Jobs Configured**
- **🔄 Weekly Training**: Sundays at 2:00 AM - Smart retraining of models older than 7 days
- **📊 Performance Monitoring**: Every 6 hours (6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM) on weekdays
- **🔄 Monthly Comprehensive**: 1st of each month at 1:00 AM - Force retrain all models
- **🧹 Daily Cleanup**: Every day at 3:00 AM - Remove old logs and temporary files

### **Performance Thresholds**
- **Model Age**: > 7 days → Automatic retraining
- **Direction Accuracy**: < 45% → Performance-based retraining
- **MAPE**: > 5% → Performance-based retraining
